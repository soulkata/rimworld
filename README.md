# rimworld
Ants directory is the unstable A12 version I've been working on. It has a lot of errors and needs debugging.
 I WHOLE section under AbilityEffect_Revive was commented out because it didn't work.
 
 Know errors:
 Something about motes when clicking on the abilities tab.
 Eggs spawn Invalid Pawns which are destroyed by rim world cuasing nothing to spawn from eggs.
 Ant Queens Dont spawn eggs(?)
